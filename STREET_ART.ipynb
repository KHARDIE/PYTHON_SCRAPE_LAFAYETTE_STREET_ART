After having painted for many years, in 2002 I stumbled upon a few packs of Clothespins while solving a simple request from a friend. I made a dress that started a career in Sculpture and Installations. Although my sculptural pieces are connected by the nature of the media and repetitive techniques, the individual works (Aside from the obvious sustainable and nostalgic implications) inspire different interpretations, which I encouraged and often find enlightening.           The legendary Wood Clothespin is the core of my current body of work. Patiently hand drilled and threaded with wire (In a loom like process), sections are created and connected to one another. Often working as planned, plans tend to change due to the nuances, accidents and lucky wrong turns of the process and medium itself. The number of clothespins I use intrigues and surprises everyone, including myself, as I struggle to acquire thousands of them, now only made overseas.

The style is fluid and spontaneous, intent upon capturing movement and natural gestures that are typical of these birds. I add pieces of forged metal onto this basic structure I've created. My goal is to keep the figure loose and flowing and try to convey this feeling of movement to the viewer.On another level, I also want the viewer to see the metal for what it is. Hot, molten, jagged, and twisted pieces of steel. The previous life of this material is a beautiful contrast to the life and movement of living things.\"), ('899', 'http://www.cityoflafayette.com/index.aspx?NID=899', 'Soaring Bird II', 'John King\\r\\n            Lyons, CO', 'http://johnkingarts.blogspot.com/', 'Lyons, CO', 'Festival Plaza West (311 W.

After having painted for many years, in 2002 I stumbled upon a few packs of Clothespins while solving a simple request from a friend. I made a dress that started a career in Sculpture and Installations. Although my sculptural pieces are connected by the nature of the media and repetitive techniques, the individual works (Aside from the obvious sustainable and nostalgic implications) inspire different interpretations, which I encouraged and often find enlightening.           The legendary Wood Clothespin is the core of my current body of work. Patiently hand drilled and threaded with wire (In a loom like process), sections are created and connected to one another. Often working as planned, plans tend to change due to the nuances, accidents and lucky wrong turns of the process and medium itself. The number of clothespins I use intrigues and surprises everyone, including myself, as I struggle to acquire thousands of them, now only made overseas.
