            Cedar Rapids, IA",http://tomnewportdesign.com/home.html,"Cedar Rapids, IA","211 N Public Rd., Mojos Plaza",Stainless Steel,"$5,000 ","My fabricated stainless steel sculptures are often outwardly abstract, but are closely linked to nature and reality. The energy and the vitality expressed in my compositions reflect a subtle inner strength and spirit that expands and interacts gracefully with space and the surrounding environment. My work is inspired by experience in floral design, jewelry design and a general observation of the world around me."

            Wayzata, Minnesota",http://juddnelsonstudios.com/,"Wayzata, Minnesota",Santiagos,Forged Steel,"$5,625 ","My sculptures are life size and the imagery is modern yet representational. The style is fluid and spontaneous, intent upon capturing movement and natural gestures that are typical of these birds. I add pieces of forged metal onto this basic structure I've created. My goal is to keep the figure loose and flowing and try to convey this feeling of movement to the viewer.On another level, I also want the viewer to see the metal for what it is. Hot, molten, jagged, and twisted pieces of steel. The previous life of this material is a beautiful contrast to the life and movement of living things."

As an artist, my desire is not only to create form and movement, but more importantly, to capture the true essence and magnificence of each creature. Nature is forever providing me countless opportunities and inspiration for new works. Through my creations, I hope to instill in others a deeper appreciation and inspiration to become a guardian of nature. I wish to create an awareness that as inhabitants of the Earth, we are all connected."

            Loveland, Colorado",http://felixvelezsculpture.com/index.php,"Loveland, Colorado",Kimbark & S. Public Road,Bronze,"$10,500 ","We are approaching a new age of spiritual art and enlightenment, when our hearts are influenced by what we see and touch. My art speaks many languages. My work is influenced by the passage of time and with God given talent, the transformation begins. Whether the subject is wild life, figurative or abstract, each piece expresses the essence of the moment, a message to the viewer. A moment in time when the viewer becomes more than an observer; he becomes a participant in the drama unfolding before his eyes.            Sculpting is my way of being creative without limits. I continually look for ways to discover new possibilities to challenge my imagination. Each piece of art, whether figurative or abstract, is an original and innovatively designed. It is delivered with excellence, performance, and integrity."

            Denver, CO",http://www.revenswanson.com/,"Denver, CO",Festival Plaza West; 311 S. Public Rd.,"Mild Steel,fused glass","$6,800 ","The Dancing Moon series is an extension of the artists figurative sculpture series. The form is reduced to the most simple and geometric shape, yet continues to represent a female presence. The steel construction was tensioned so that a windy breeze or push from the finger tips makes it spring to life. The form is to reflect life as a celebration in a whimsical dance with the viewer and nature."

            Evergreen, Colorado",http://www.linkesculpture.com/,"Evergreen, Colorado","210 S. Public Road, Cannon Mine",Bronze,"$6,200 ","He calls it Essentialism, but I dont know. Harold takes the perfectly good bronze figurative dance sculptures hes carved for 25 years and subtracts everything that makes them--uh, fussy. Gone are the eyelashes and fingernails and heck, all of the details. The texture is gone and even the color (his new pieces are all-white bronze). He even subtracted the volume. Yep. They are like, say potato chips, but really curvy and long. You gotta see em. No really. Youve never seen anything like it.            He lived all his life in the West. A grey-beard, Stanford boy--engineering. Uses computers to design his prototypes and then makes them out of resins and such then casts them in bronze. Says people like bronze and that hes seen bronze four-thousand years old. I think he likes that its permanent--and beautiful."

Sculpting since 1979, Greg says of his work, In 1989, I created my first bronze sculpture, fell in love with this method of expression, and have been casting works in bronze ever since.            A natural story teller, Greg weaves a tale into every sculpture he creates. Greg has gained national recognition for his work depicting both wildlife and human figures.People always want to know where I get my inspiration, he says. Greg finds an infinite supply of subject matter in Gods creation the world around us, adding, I draw my ideas from my personal experiences and interests. These interests include the outdoors, nature, and people, especially family. His wife Cheryl and two sons, Jonathan and Jeremy, and now his grandchildren, have provided subject matter for Greg's sculptures over the years."

Longmont, CO",http://www.customdoormaven.com/,"Longmont, CO",NW Emma and S. Public Rd,Pine,"$20,000 ","I have an intimate relationship with wood. Each piece has its own secret. Discovering sensation in wood requires a lot of faith and patience. Laughter, pain, wonder, sensuality, all deserve to be touched. My work allows a visual and tactile connection with these primal emotions.With my favorite tool, the bandsaw, I am able to literally turn my sculptures inside out exposing the true middle of the tree, usually the most hidden and protected. Finding the soft, sensual nature inside a rough material is an exciting challenge.Putting my saw blades into giant wood beams, sculpting rough edges into beckoning twists and cubes is all about listening/trusting that the soul of the wood will reveal itself.Sometimes this happens.For me, warm wood sculptures and doors are a welcome relief from the frantic qualities of today's world. I invite you to touch them as they touch you."

            Lafayette, CO",http://www.bluestemstudioarts.com/Site/Home.html,"Lafayette, CO",SW Emma and S. Public Road - by El Mercado,Colorado Marble,"$28,800 ","Stone. When I carve, or even think of carving stone, I feel my brainwaves shift. The energy in my body slows down, grounds itself and opens to what I experience as the voice and motion of Universe.            I am leaving the marks of the different chisels, faces where different quarrying machines and processes have caused the marble to break in different ways, telling us more about the nature of the rock. How it takes a polish is just one of these aspects.            A face is so rich with mystery; reverberant stories; wonder. Most will see the distinct features of a face, voluptuous and elaborate. For me carving the subtleties of the plane of the cheek is the most transporting. Like touching Space.            How do these incredible forms of ours arise out of the Earth, out of the Universe? I can enjoy Science explaining that all day and the sense of the miraculous is not diminished for me. I would not be surprised if one day some rocketship snapped a shot of Deep Space and radioed back a face looking at us. Maybe it would wink.            Flower of Life is marveling at our beautifully complex human form coming out of the 'chaos' of the Universe; out of simpler orders.            It is a face of wisdom and compassion, these qualities I see as the true flower of our human life.            Many people have stopped to chat during the carving process (where I've been working is not very private.) They are all full of kindness. I sense what they are recognizing is their own wisdom and compassion; feeling this reinforced and celebrated."

Public Rd),Clothespins,"$6,000 ","Unlike traditional approaches, the meaning and direction of my artwork develops post medium discovery. After having painted for many years, in 2002 I stumbled upon a few packs of Clothespins while solving a simple request from a friend. I made a dress that started a career in Sculpture and Installations. Although my sculptural pieces are connected by the nature of the media and repetitive techniques, the individual works (Aside from the obvious sustainable and nostalgic implications) inspire different interpretations, which I encouraged and often find enlightening.           The legendary Wood Clothespin is the core of my current body of work. Patiently hand drilled and threaded with wire (In a loom like process), sections are created and connected to one another. Often working as planned, plans tend to change due to the nuances, accidents and lucky wrong turns of the process and medium itself. The number of clothespins I use intrigues and surprises everyone, including myself, as I struggle to acquire thousands of them, now only made overseas. On loan for one more year!This work was installed as part of the 2013 Art on the Street program. We are happy this sculpture has a longer visit with us, butit isnot eligible for the Peoples Choice Award."
